<span class='section-head'><h3>Back2GPT</h3>&emsp;<b>May 2023</b>&emsp;<p>Completed | Python | LLMs, LangChain, Markprompt</p></span>
<div class='collapsible'>
    <p>
        As part of my work as a Grader at NJIT, I was tasked with setting up a bot that could respond to students' questions on the official class discord, referring to the course material and some select sources.
        This was still in the early days of  LLM use, but the pipeline would later come to be known as RAG; Retreival Augmented Generation.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I needed to do was mine the course website's content from the Professor's repo, along with a healthy amount of Wikipedia articles, and put them all in a format that can be parsed in MarkPrompt.
        From there I was able to implement a discord bot to allow users to chat with the LLM, and it was complete.
        Setting up the bot wasn't as trivial as it sounds as I had to handle the stream data in a way that worked with Discord's API, and reformat the sources to make sense for the format.

<span class='section-head'><h3>GalaxyGen</h3>&emsp;<b>March 2023</b>&emsp;<p>Completed | Python, Javascript | Flask, OpenCV, NetworkX</p></span>
<div class='collapsible'>
    <p>
        GalaxyGen is a tool I made to generate, visualize, and edit psuedo-random Galaxies for sci-fi settings, following the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperlane">Hyperlane</a> system from Star Wars.
        GalaxyGen is set up to generate "natural" hyperlanes which will generally avoid having a homogenous pattern, allowing for interesting logistics & routing. It's also set up to generate "clusters" of resources given some parameters, which add another dimension to the geography of the Galaxy.        
    </p>
    <p>
        This all is displayed in a locally-hosted Web App that allows users to view & edit the galaxy in real time. This includes visualizing or editing fictional countries plotted over the map, or the resource clusters.
        Galaxies are generated with a script that takes a black & white density map from the user- everything else is generated for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made this tool for a non-technical group, so this was my first foray into making something that's truly <em>user-friendly.</em> By all accounts I failed (I still get teased about it to this day) but I learned a lot in the process, and that's what matters.

<span class='section-head'><h3>Stingus Stats</h3>&emsp;<b>December 2022</b>&emsp;<p>Completed | Python | Flask, OAuth2, Heroku/DigitalOcean</p></span>
<div class='collapsible'>
    <p>
        Stingus Stats was a data collection project centered on determining the drop rates of in-game items from Destiny 2 depending on game mode and other such factors.
        It was a fully functional front and back end, where the back-end collected item drop events from anyone who signed up for it (far more complicated than it sounds), and the front-end collected that data into easy-to-understand stats.
        The plan was to make some more advanced tools going from that, but the game started dying due to a very controversial update, and I lost interest.

<span class='section-head'><h3>Message Count +</h3>&emsp;<b>March 2020</b>&emsp;<p>Completed | C# | MongoDB, Discord.NET</p></span>
<div class='collapsible'>
    <p>
        This is a project that is completely defunct but holds a lot of sentimental value to me as it's one of my first ventures into data collection and visualization. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The overall task was simple enough- record how many messages are sent at any given moment in any given channel, and plot that data in useful ways.
        The problem is that I wasn't particularly good at dealing with the various edge cases that comes with a constant stream of old, new, and inconsistently formatted data. I also had no idea how to generate graphs from code.
        I also scope-creeped <em>hard</em> every time I tried to make it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall I learned a lot of valuable lessons from this project. One of these days I'll get back to it and implement it properly.
