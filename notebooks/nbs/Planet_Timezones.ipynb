        "If Humanity ever colonizes another planet, two things are certain- we're going to want to talk to them, and we're going to want to sell things to them. The problem is, how are we going to do that if we can't agree on what time it is?\n",
        "\n",
        "We first ran into this problem in the mid-19th century with Railroads. Until then every town ran on Solar Time (i.e. Position of the sun at that town's specific location)- which made it incredibly hard to manage train schedules. Each town would be a few minutes off of the other, and so you'd have to adjust each train's schedule based on what station you're at. Additionally passengers would have to constantly adjust their clocks/watches based on their location. \n",
        "\n",
        "Nowadays, we could probably manage to make Solar Time work- digital clocks and logistics software solves these issues. Even then it would still be a feat in itself to make it work at scale, but I think we could.\n",
        "\n",
        "This works at the scale of Earth so long that we can all roughly agree on what a Day is. This works most of the time, but falls apart at the poles- which is fine because there aren't a whole lot of people on the poles. But this system falls apart when we start thinking about other planets- which we haven't had to do until rather recently. "

        "      - (Any system that is robust to instant communication should work for real communication with real latency)\n",
        " - We can colonize on practically any planet provided that has something resembling a solar cycle\n",

        " - The relation between written time and solar time must be somewhat consistent\n",
        " - It must be easy to communicate the current time at any location to a person at a different location\n",
        " - There must be some form of Universal Reference Time (like UTC on Earth)\n",
